# DotaPlusRankCounter

Small script written in Python 3.7 that scrapes the Stratz API (http://stratz.com) for the number of players who have achieved Master tier on a hero.
Big thanks to Stratz for their assistance in getting this script working!

May take a while depending on the speed of the internet connection and the number of heroes/master tier players. 

## Prerequisites

This script requires the `requests` library availible via `pip install requests`

## Usage

Run the script using `python main.py` or `python main.py -o` if you would like a csv with the results to be generated.
